            <p id="typewriter-paragraph1">I wake up disoriented in a foggy, unfamiliar place. The air is damp and cold. Twisted trees and jagged rocks loom around me. My head pounds as fear sets in. I find two other survivors, equally lost. 
                Relief and hope spark as we join forces to navigate this strange terrain.</p>
            <p id="typewriter-paragraph2">
                I waste no time in introducing myself. We exchange stories, piecing together fragments of our memories. It becomes clear that we are part of a larger mystery, 
                one that we must solve to find our way back home.
